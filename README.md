Hi, this is Tianhua Xia. 

I have been an ASIC design engineer at Qualcomm, San Diego since 2021. I am working on SoC low power management design.
Before joining Qualcomm, I received the M.Eng degree from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2020, and the B.S degree from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2019.

Here you can find my resume, and the reports of my previous research: Softmax acceleration for Transformer models, GPU accelerated algorithm for high resolution 3D printing, 
and Neuromorphic circuit design for object detection.
